# Megan_Financial_Bank-MFB-
The MFB project is a C++ console application which mimics the actual banking program with features such as ACCOUNT CREATION, MONEY DEPOSIT, WITHDRAWAL, LOANING SYSTEM, BANK STATEMENTS, and PIN RESET.
Various C++ features such as OOP(bank account classes), templates, loops, binary files, switch statements, exception handling and so on have been used to make these features possible
Certain parts of the source code have been commented out to describe what these lines of code are suppossed to do and how they function
An AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM is created to ensure secure access and protection of each account's data.
An EXCEPTION HANDLING SYSTEM is created to prevent users from entering wrong data at all scenarios into the program which would otherwise cause it to break
